This side project is inspired by [Welcome to the 168 Hours Time Tracking Challenge! - Laura Vanderkam](https://lauravanderkam.com/2017/09/welcome-168-hours-time-tracking-challenge/). You could leverage Alfred and Google Sheets to track your time with ease. The goal is to track your time in a way that is easy to understand how much time you spend on.
